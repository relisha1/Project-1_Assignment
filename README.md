**Question 1**

One read-world application of C Programming: 
C programming is commonly used in real-world systems that require speed and direct control of hardware. Examples include operating systems such as Linux, embedded systems like microcontrollers, and devices such as traffic lights, washing machines, and medical equipment.

The difference between syntax errors and semantic errors:
A syntax error happens when the rules of the C language are not followed, such as forgetting a semicolon or misspelling a keyword. These errors prevent the program from compiling. A semantic error, on the other hand, occurs when the program logic is incorrect. In this case, the program may compile successfully but produce incorrect results.   

The stages of the C compilation process and the output of each stage:
The C compilation process happens in several stages. First, preprocessing handles directives like #include and #define. Next, compilation translates the C source code into assembly language while checking for syntax errors. After that, assembly converts the assembly code into object code. Finally, linking combines the object code with required libraries to create an executable file.

**Question 2**

Sample input/output


Brief explanation of program logic:
The program uses a while loop to allow repeated execution until the user chooses to exit. Conditional statements (if and else if) are used to handle different menu options. A for loop is used to print numbers, while continue skips a specific value and break ends the program. This structure allows the program to interact smoothly with the user.

**Question 3**

Short written explanation:
The factorial function uses recursion by calling itself until it reaches a base case. The displayFactorial function demonstrates function reuse by calling the recursive function.
Recursion is useful because it can make complex problems easier to solve and understand. However, it can also consume more memory and may cause stack overflow if a proper base case is not defined.

**Question 4**
System Description

The temperature sensor measures the surrounding temperature and sends the data to the Arduino. The Arduino processes this data and decides whether to turn the fan on or off. When the temperature exceeds a set value, the fan is activated automatically.

**Question 5**

Briefly explain how control flow, functions, and embedded systems concepts work together in building a real-world system:

In real-world systems, control flow is used to make decisions based on conditions, functions help organize and reuse code, and embedded systems apply these concepts to interact with hardware. When combined, these concepts allow developers to build reliable systems such as automatic fans, smart lighting, and temperature monitoring devices.
